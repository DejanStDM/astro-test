JavaScript Usage Guidelines for Builder.io Integration
Use only vanilla JavaScript or external libraries for all components.
For sliders, use the Swiper.js library.
Place all JavaScript code in separate files within src/scripts/modules/, using clear and descriptive filenames. Follow the structure and naming conventions of the existing example files in that directory.
Do not include any <script> tags or JavaScript code directly inside .astro component files. .astro files should contain only HTML markup.
Keep all JavaScript modular and separated from component markup.
